            <h3>Forest Fire Prediction</h3>
            <p>FOREST FIRE PREDICTIONðŸ”¥ðŸŒ² A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

                ABOUT THE PROJECTðŸ”Ž Objective: Predict the Forest Weather Index (FWI) for forest fire risk 
                assessment using meteorological parameters like temperature, rainfall, ISI, wind speed, etc. 
                Data: Trained on the Algerian Forest Fire dataset containing historical weather conditions and forest fire incidents. 
                Approach: Explored and engineered relevant features, trained various regression models (Simple, Lasso, Ridge) on the data,
                 with Ridge Regression providing the best predictive performance. Deployment: Deployed on Azure.</p>

            <h3>Diabetes Prediction</h3>
            <p>In a diabetes prediction project, data (e.g., glucose level, BMI) is processed, split, and analyzed for key patterns. 
                Models like Decision Tree and Support Vector Classifier (SVC) are trained, with EDA and feature scaling enhancing 
                accuracy. Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision) determine model performance, and Decision Tree feature importance 
                highlights influential factors. The best model is then saved for deployment, aiding diabetes prediction and 
                healthcare decisions.

            <h3>EDA on Student performance</h3>
            <p>"EDA with Student Performance" primarily focuses on analyzing student performance data. Here's a description of the project:
                Objective: The project aims to explore and analyze the relationship between various factors (like gender, test preparation course completion, and scores in different subjects) and the overall student performance.               
                Data Analysis:                
                The data is visualized using histograms and scatter plots to uncover patterns and insights. Key variables include gender, scores in subjects (math, reading, writing), and whether students completed a test preparation course. The analysis specifically highlights the impact (or lack thereof) of the test preparation course on student performance. Key Insights:                
                In general, the test preparation course does not significantly affect student performance, regardless of gender. Surprisingly, students who did not complete the test preparation course tend to perform better than those who did. Visualizations:                
                Histograms showing the distribution of average scores by gender and course completion. Multiple scatter plots and density plots are used to visualize relationships between different features. This analysis focuses on understanding the factors influencing student test outcomes, providing educators with insights into performance patterns. â€‹

            <h3>Car Sales Analysis using Power BI</h3>
            <p>The Car Sales Analysis project involves a comprehensive analysis of car sales data to derive insights into revenue, 
                profit, labor costs, and discounts across different states and car models. Using Power BI, it highlights key metrics 
                like sales by year and month, state-wise and model-wise sales, and profit margins by manufacturer. The project allows
                 stakeholders to understand sales performance, track profitability, and make data-driven decisions for improved 
                 operational and sales strategies.

            <h3>HR Analytics</h3>
            <p>This SQL project focuses on analyzing HR data to provide insights into employee performance, retention, and
                 satisfaction. By utilizing various SQL queries and data transformation techniques, the project aims to identify 
                 key workforce metrics, trends in employee turnover, and factors influencing productivity, aiding strategic HR 
                 decision-making.
